<p>The development of Edtech:ExpoCalc, which was made by Enguanzo, Reyes, Datinguinoo, Grutas, and Borcelango, is an educational technology with a mission to ensure a fun learning experience for students and build a greater relationship with the subject. Others could pick up math lessons as quickly as they could; others cannot. While some find math challenging, one of the site creators enjoys computer engineering as a hobby and plans to pursue it in college. After we started our research, we knew what we wanted to do. Thereafter, we knew how difficult it is to not understand enough to comprehend and keep up with others, and that not all teachers can effectively communicate their lessons to their students.</p>
 
<p>Other than that, students often find it difficult to study, particularly when it comes to math with numerous numbers; they typically just search for the answers online without understanding how they were arrived at. Thus, we created this website to assist aspiring math whizzes in learning how to solve math problems by providing a step-by-step solution. By doing this, we hope to realise our vision for the mathematics field's future, which includes keeping up with the fast-paced world without sacrificing learning ethics. Although, originally, the target of our research focused on only one grade, as we consult experts, they are able to confirm that our output can be used by other grade levels, starting with grade 8 students.</p>
 
<p>We are building a safe and beneficial website, but we will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work helps others achieve this outcome.</p>
